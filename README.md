## What is this?

This is a project I'm working on to Automate Man In The Middle Attacks. You can use the simple terminal app, and just type in a few options, and answer a couple of prompts, and perform advanced mitm techniques, such as DNS Poisoning. This project uses, and will always only use exclusively builtin python libraries and functions to ensure trust and safety.
